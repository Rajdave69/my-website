> Hello and Welcome! I'm Raj Dave

I'm a 13-year-old hobbyist Programmer and Photographer. I can code in various languages. I'm a self-taught programmer and love to learn new things.
I'd say I'm pretty good at anything tech related, which include Computer Hardware, Software and Networking.
I am also the Developer and Host of the [Moonball Network](https://moonball.io) too. Which is a 24/7 Minecraft Server Network with multiple game-modes.
I'd be happy to help anyone with any tech issue, Feel free to contact me through my socials which are listed below!
